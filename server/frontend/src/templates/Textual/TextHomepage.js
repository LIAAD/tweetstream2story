      <h3>Narrative Extraction from Journalistic Text</h3>
      <p className="text-justify mt-3 mb-4 ps-3">
        Text2Story is a project focused on creating a narrative extraction and
        visualization tool. A framework that allows its users to create a story
        like representation from journalistic articles written in Portuguese and
        English in an automated way.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Narrative Extraction Matters?</h3>
      <p className="text-justify mt-3 ps-3">
        Nowadays journalistic content is distributed in multiple formats, mostly
        through the web and specific internet-based applications running on
        smartphones and tablets. Text is a very important format, but readers
        (or more accurately users or information consumers) heavily rely on
        images, videos, slideshows, charts and infographics. Textual content is
        still the main representation of information.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mb-4 ps-3">
        Any journalistic subject (e.g. Trump and Russia) is described in one or
        more texts produced by journalists and possibly commented by readers.
        Many of those subjects are followed during days, weeks or months. To
        grasp a possibly vast and somewhat complex set of interconnected news
        articles, readers would greatly benefit from tools that summarize those
        articles by showing main actors, their interplay and their trajectories
        in time and space, their motivations, main events, causal relations of
        events and outcomes. In other words, tools that extract narrative
        elements and re-represent them in formats that convey the essential
        story but that is more efficiently consumed by the users.
      </p>
      <h3>What does Text2Story do?</h3>
      <p className="text-justify mt-3 mb-4 ps-3">
        This vibrant research line poses many challenging problems in
        information extraction and automatic production of media content. At
        this project want to be able to extract narratives/stories from news
        articles or collections of related news articles (unstructured data)
        about the same (or related) subject, representing those narratives in
        intermediate data structures (structured data) and making this available
        to subsequent media production processes (semi-automatic generation of
        slide shows, infographics and other visualizations, video sequences,
        games, etc.).
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify mt-3 mb-4 ps-3">
        In summary, our aim in the Text2Story project is to develop a conceptual
        framework and operational pipeline for the extraction of narratives from
        textual sources. The project focuses on the automatic processing of
        journalistic text in written Portuguese.
